#### 3 Different types of shapes:
    Circles
    Rectangles
    Ellipses
    Randomised Polygons

##### Artist statement:
    I observed the way the mountain peaks were rising and falling and wanted to simulate a random environment where the scene changes and gives the illusion as if the background is changing as the car moves, almost creating a 3D illusion.
    I am rendering a rectrangle utilising perlin noise to carve out the edges and tracking mouse movement to descale the x axis scale as the mouse drives the car forward.

    The only limitation is the generator itself. To generate a more intricate scene with a huge number of procedural elements, it would be easier to use a well established Engine such that we can focus on the creativity and fun aspects more than mathematically crafting basic shapes

#### Randomness:
    Each reroll randomises the mountains. The mountains get randomised crests and troughs, locations and scales. The stars are also randomised and include mixtures of twinkling and flickering stars. Whether a star is one type or the other is also randomised on reroll/refresh,

#### Responds to the mouse(Reactivity):
    The car will track mouse movement and change position relative to the mouse position. The mountains get replaced too as the car moves.
